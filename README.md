#Machine Learning
This repository represents all things that I am learning by doing and practicing. Some of those are written using  built in libraries and some are manually implemented.

Some datasets are collected from superdatascience.com

The explanation of different function I have used will be explained and updated in wiki. You may check it.

Feel free to contribute better explanation for others for better understanding.
